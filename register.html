    <p class="para-spacer">
        Breckenridge is one of the highest ski areas in North America. You are nearly two miles above sea level. The key is the elevation where you sleep, not so much as where you go during the day.
        Be aware that driving straight to Breckenridge from a lower elevation may not allow your body to acclimate to the higher elevations. If you are concerned about the elevation, you may want to stay in Denver 
        or another area overnight before traveling to Breckenridge.
    </p>

    <div class="column-container">
        <div class="column-50 column-left-spacer">
            <p class="para-spacer">
                HYDRATE! The biggest loss of fluid from the human body is from the air you exhale. The air is very dry at altitude. Thirst is not a good guide as to how much you should drink. Pay attention to your urine.
                Clear is good. If yellow, you need to drink more water.
            </p>

            <p class="para-spacer">
                ACUTE MOUNTAIN SICKNESS OR ALTITUDE ILLNESS is not subtle. 20-25% of visitors have problems and perhaps half require treatment. Expect shortness of breath when you climb stairs, or are walking.
                A mild headache or light nasuea may occur and are not a concern. Anything more serious, call 911.
            </p>

            <p class="para-spacer">
                Altitude is no respect for age or gender. The effect of altitude illness occurs usually within 48 hours, although some effects are immediate while others may not occur for five days.
                If you are coughing and are breathless, call 911. Don't wait for the effects to pass, it will not happen.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="column-50">
            <p class="para-spacer">
                PREVENTION: There is a prescription medication called Acetazolamide or Diamox, taken two days prior to coming to the high country which can prevent altitude illness. Ask your doctor to prescribe this medication 
                if you are concerned. Anti-inflammatories, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or Naproxen sodium are also helpful.
            </p>

            <p class="para-spacer">
                DIET: High-Carb, low fat meals and lighter meals are recommended for the first few days. Limit alcohol intake for the first few days as well, as it is dehydrating.
            </p>

            <p class="para-spacer">
                MOISTURIZE: Use moisturizing creams early in the day. Stay ahead of dryness, and use sun block!
            </p>

            <p class="para-spacer">
                DRINKING WATER: Don't give in to your temptation to drink from that sparkling stream. The animals in Summit County carry a parasite called Giardia, which will give you the mother of all diarrhea. Be careful.
